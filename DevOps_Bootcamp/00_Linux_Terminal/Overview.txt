Linux Terminal
    - terminal emulator and is a crucial part of any linux systme because it basically allows you to access the system through a shell
    - a shell is a program that takes commands from the user and gives them to the OS's kernel to execute. It's also called the command interreter. The shell gets started when the user
        logs in or starts the terminal
    - Linus is a CASE-SENSITIVE OS

    Terminal vs Console?
        - Terminal is a console opened via a GUI

Linux Command Structure
    <command> <options> <arguments>
    Example:
        ls -la /
    
    Example:
        ping -c 1 8.8.8.8

    Bad Example:
        ping 8.8.8.8 -c 1

Man Pages:
    Manual pages
    
    Example:

    man ls
        - gives us a manual for the command "ls"
        - we can do this for most commands we don't remember how to user

        If you see something like [OPTION]...
            the [] means that OPTION is optional and the ... means we can have more than one

            thus we can run ls with many different options:
                ls -lah /

        Example print out for: "man ls" 

        LS(1)                            User Commands                           LS(1)

        NAME
            ls - list directory contents

        SYNOPSIS
            ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

        DESCRIPTION
            List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).
            Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort  is  speci‐
            fied.

            Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
            too.

        Pressing 'g' will go to the beginning of the man pages
        Pressing 'G' will go to the end

        Searching for a string top -> down
            /<string>

        Pressign 'n' will go to the next occurance where <string> is found
        Pressing 'N' will go the the previous occurance where <string> is found (I believe )

        Searching for a string down -> top
            ?<string>
        
Type

    type <command> 
        - will give some useful info about the command

Help
    help <command>
        - since built-in commands such as cd don't have a man page, we use help

    Example:
    help cd

    Example:

    cd --help <- This way can work for non-built in cmds as wells

How to serach for command feature/keyword

    man -k <keyword we are searching for>

    Example:

    man -k ifconfig

    man -k "copy files"

    man -k uname

    This is similar to the command: apropos

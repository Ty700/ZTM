This is gonna be tough for me... I always hated this

Strings in python are immutable

name = "Tyler"

we can't change "Tyler" every, str is a constant essentially

no longer at the days of 

name[0] = 'F'
    -> Strings are immutable and this is illegal in Python.
    -> Instead, we have to completely reassign the value

Fundamental Data Types:
    int
    float
    bool
    str => string
    list (non-modifyable array)
    tuple (modifyable array)
    set (map? Forget)
    dict(hash map)

    complex -> Complex number
        - If I ever forget what this is... RIP since I am not explaining.
    
    bin(number) -> binary version of the number
    int('0b101', 2) -> will print out 5.
        - Converts the binary to an int. 2 is the base.
Classes:
    => Custom types, like C++
    => Can group members/methods together to make an obj

Specialized Data Types:
    Modules used from libraries
    "Extensions" to Python

None => NULL?
    - The absense of value

"None => NULL" 
    - I should prob stop trying to relate everything to C/C++... feel like this is gonna bite me in the butt (like it has every other time I've tried learning Py)

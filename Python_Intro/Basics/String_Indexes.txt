Like C, strings are stored contigously (Spelling?)

name = "Tyler"

name[2] = L

print(name[2]) will print "L"

Python has a unique way to parse a string

we can do 

print(name[0:2]) will print "Ty"

[start: stop: step]

name[::2]

will print "tlr" (I think)

name[1::]

will print "yler" 

name[:2] will print "tyl" 

name[::1] -> default behavior so "Tyler"

name[-1] will print "r"
    - this is cool tbh

name[::-1] -> will print "relyt"
    -> name backwards

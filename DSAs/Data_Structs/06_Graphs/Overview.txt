Graphs are probably the most important data structure

A linked list is a special type of graph, so is a tree

Directed vs Undirected:
    Directed is not bidirectional, can only traverse one way from a node
    Undirected is a highway, directed is a one-way street

Weighted vs Unweighted Graph
    Values can be applied to the edges and nodes

Edges:
    Lines connecting the nodes
Nodes:
    (verticies) -> Things being connected

Cyclic
    When nodes are connected in a circle fation
    - start at one node, traverse to all diffferent nodes, and end up at starting node

Acyclic
    - Nodes are not connected in a circle fation

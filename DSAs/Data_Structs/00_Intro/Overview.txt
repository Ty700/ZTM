A data struct is a container for data
    - Backpack
    - Fridge
    - Box
    - Cabinet

We wouldn't put paper in the fridge...
We wouldn't put ice cream in a backpack for later enjoyment

Same for data structures

You use them for a specific function since some data structures are better than others at certain functions

I know most of this, but a refresher is always good.

What is good code?
    Code that is:
        - Readable
        - Scalable
            - How do we measure this? Big O


Rules:
    1. Assume worst case scenario
    2. Remove constants
        O(1 + n/2 + 1) => O(n)
    3. Different terms for inputs
        Example:
            countBoxes(boxes, boxes2){
                boxes.forEach(function(boxes){
                    console.log(boxes);
                }
            });
            
            - NOTICE BOXES2 IS THE ARRAY BEING INDEXED OVER
            boxes2.forEach(function(boxes2){
                console.log(boxes);
            });

        We would have n for boxes and m for boxes2

        Thus this will be O(n + m) -> becauses they can differ in size
    
    4. Drop Non-Dominants
        -> Essentially look at the greatest power

        n^2 >> n thus if we have a function that is O(n^2 + n + 100) it would be O(n^2)

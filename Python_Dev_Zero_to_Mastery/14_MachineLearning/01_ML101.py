# Steps
    # 0 - Goal Defining
    # 1 - Import the data
    # 2 - Clean it
        # Fix missing tags, etc in the data
    # 3 - Split the data. 
        # Training Set 
        # Test Set
    # 4 - Create a model
        # Test with different algorithms, etc
    # 5 - Check the output
        # Accuracy testing, etc
    # 6 - Improve

# Hardest Part? My guess is importing, collecting, and parsing the data

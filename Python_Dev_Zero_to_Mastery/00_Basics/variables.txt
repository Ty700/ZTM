Stores data under an alias

Pretty much like every other language...

Best Practices for Py:
    Variables should be snake_case
    Start with lowercase or underscore
    Letters, numbers, underscores
    Case sensitive
    Don't overwrite keywords
    Constants are all caps

Dunder(?) variables:
    __debug__
        - two underscores
        - basically are meant to be left alone
        - don't create a variable with dunders

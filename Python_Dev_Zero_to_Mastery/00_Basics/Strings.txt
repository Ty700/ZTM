Strings are just a piece of text

Example:
    'Hi and goodbye!'

or
    "Hi and goodbye!"

Can be write with double or single quotes

print(type("Hi and goodbye!"))
    - will print out 'str'

Long strings:
    print("""
    ALL
    of
    This                    WILL 
    BE PRINTED  



    like this
    
    """)

will result in:

    ALL
    of
    This                    WILL 
    BE PRINTED  



    like this
    
This is by far the weirdest thing to me...

String Concatenation:
    Adding strings

    string = "Hello" + "Tyler"

    print(string) will pritn "HelloTyler"

    String Concatenation only works with strings... weird. Almost like it's string Concatenation and not int Concatenation

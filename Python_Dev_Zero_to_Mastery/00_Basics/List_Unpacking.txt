say we have 

basket = [1,2,3]

and we want to have a different variable for 1, 2, and 3

we can do 

a,b,c = 1,2,3

and print(a), print(b), and print(c) it will print "1" "2" and "3"

what if we had [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

what if we just want 1, 2, and 3?

a,b,c, *other = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

printing other will print "[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

what if we do?

a, b, c, *0ther, d = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
other = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
d = 9
